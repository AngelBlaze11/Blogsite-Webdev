    <p>
      Hi, Welcome to my Blog. 
      </p>
      <p>I am Angel Blaze Candinato, 19 years old. I am simple person but a modest one. I love acting, playing different roles, an actress to be specific. I also love broadcasting or reporting news but not writing news (but other says I`m good also).
        I am a friendly person but a sometimes an introvert also. I don`t like things like other girls love (you know girls stuff, make up, dresses or whatever). But I love modest dresses like the 90s one. Currently, I am pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information System but I dunno I can do this. I hope I can with God`s help.
