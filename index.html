   <h2> <p>Welcome to our blogsite!
    </p> </h2>
    <p>This is my family. We are 9 members in the family, 7 siblings and of course my parents. We are a very simple, happy and contented of what we have. My parents are both self employed but they are able to provide what we need even our wants. What I love about my family is the fact that we have God. I am very thankful to God that I grow up in this God-fearing people because it makes us really what we are today. We are molded by the good values and good works. Thanks be to God!
